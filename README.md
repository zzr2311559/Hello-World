# Hello-World
Glad to meet you guys!
I'm trying to learn programming by a new way
Honestly, I'm not a crazy fan of coding at this moment, I'm here to expand my knowledge and try to develop my hobby of coding, maybe some day I can become a guru(That's the word I just learned) .
Hope to make more friends here!
